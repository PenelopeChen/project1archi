# Archi

This is the 2nd project I created at the General Assembly SEIC60 Course. Archi is a simple website about architects & their buildings, which are all part of a database system. Users can interact with the site by collecting info about architects & their buildings. 

The tech stack used for this project includes: 
- Ruby (v2.7.7) on Rails (v5.2.8.1) including ActiveRecord (v5.2.8.1)
- PostgreSQL (v15)
- Embedded Ruby
- SCSS

This project will be deployed on Heroku as GitHub cannot display projects with Postgresql.

## Project Components 

- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- A checklist that helped with ensuring everything is in place (Notion) https://www.notion.so/Checklist-838ff67b46924d8cac0127eaaf7594a4

Feel free to use Archi on archi.herokuapp.com!

## Approach 
Being methodical when it comes to doing complex projects with multiple components helps with efficient and well-thought processes required.
