# Archi

This is the 2nd project I created at the General Assembly SEIC60 Course. Archi is a simple website about architects & their buildings, which are all part of a database system. Users can interact with the site by collecting info about architects & their buildings. 

The tech stack used for this project includes: 
- Ruby (v2.7.7) on Rails (v5.2.8.1) including ActiveRecord (v5.2.8.1)
- PostgreSQL (v15)
- Embedded Ruby
- SCSS

This project will be deployed on (something.io) as GitHub cannot display projects with Postgresql.

## Project Components 

- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- Pseudocodes (coming soon on Notion)

- Wireframe design (coming soon on Figma...gonna w8 to learn Bootstrap, Cloudinary & SCSS 1st)

Feel free to use Archi (coming soon...) on (github url coming soon)!

## Approach 
Being methodical when it comes to doing complex projects with multiple components helps with efficient and well-thought processes required.
